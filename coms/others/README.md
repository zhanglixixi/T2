# utilities
Some useful small scripts dealing with tiny but maybe frequently called tasks.

`fix-oldwesvcf.sh` 

It fixes the format issue of the vcf file created by our current WES flow
(or sometimes we called old, which meant to be updated but unfortunately not yet...). 
So that the corrected vcf file can be read by bcftools and other tools without complaining.
